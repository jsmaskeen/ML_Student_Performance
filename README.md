### Linear regression model for determining student performance, given certain factors.

### Dataset: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression/)

### Tasks performed:
1. EDA.
2. Finding relation between features of the dataset.
3. Normalizing and implementing multiple linear regression from scratch using gradient descent.
4. Implemented K fold regression from scratch to better train the model.
5. Lastly, looked at the Linear Regression provided by `scikit-learn` library.
